# 2023 Feelings Wheel

Site where you spin a wheel of feelings, and when you land on a particular feeling a memory involving that feeling appears.

Inspiration taken from:
- How my favorite anime (Mob Psycho 100) handles emotions
- A pillow with a similar feelings circle from the Imbue office

Some starter code taken from this [Hack Club workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/spinning_wheel/).
